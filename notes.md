# To Do

- Add feedback so users can submit ideas and suggestions as github issues.
- Remove prefixes from names. Add more detail.
- Activity feed has wrong timestamps. And it doesn't seem to always update. I guess it stops at 100 events?
- Tapping on items in the activity feed fails to open anything
